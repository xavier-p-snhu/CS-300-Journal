## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem to be solved was to find the most efficient data structure for storing course information.
## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I analyzed different data structures to understand which would be the fastest for which operations.
## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The biggest roadblock I encountered was that I initially needed to understand how HashTables worked. After dedicating much time to studying them, I confidently understand how they work.
## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Before this course, the only method I would use for storing data would be variables, Vectors, or Arrays. Now I know how to use HashTables, LinkedLists, and Binary Trees.
## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Practice makes progress! By working on this software project and getting feedback from my instructor, I improve my skills in making readable code.
